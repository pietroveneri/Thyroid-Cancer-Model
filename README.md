## Summary

An independent undergraduate research project focused on building a predictive model for thyroid cancer recurrence using structured patient data (n=383). The final model, based on AdaBoost, achieved 96% accuracy and AUC 0.98 on a hold-out test set. The pipeline includes preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble comparisons, and rigorous internal validation.

---

## Model Highlights

- Preprocessing: Label encoding, standardization, PCA, and SMOTE/undersampling.
- Model Comparison: Evaluated 11 classifiers using 5-fold cross-validation.
- Final Model: AdaBoost selected via cross-validation and tuned using GridSearchCV.
- Validation:
   - Hold-out test evaluation
   - 5-fold CV on multiple metrics
   - Bootstrap resampling (1,000 iterations)
   - ROC curves and AUC
   - Calibration and learning/validation curves

---

## Key Results

- Test Accuracy: 96%
- AUC: 0.98
- Precision/Recall: Balanced across classes (~92â€“98%)
- Calibration: Good alignment between predicted probabilities and true outcomes
- Overfitting: No significant gap between training and test performance
